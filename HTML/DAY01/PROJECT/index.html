    <h2>Who is Frontend Developer?</h2>

    <p>A Frontend Developer is a software professional who focuses on building the parts of a website or web application that users see and interact with directly. 
        They use technologies like HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity to bring designs to life in the browser. 
        Frontend developers are responsible for creating responsive, visually appealing,
         and user-friendly interfaces that work smoothly across different devices and browsers.  </p>

    <p> They often work closely with designers to implement UI/UX ideas and with backend developers to connect the user interface to the server and databases. In short,
         a frontend developer ensures that the website not only looks good but also provides a seamless and engaging experience for the user.</p>
